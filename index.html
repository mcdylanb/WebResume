    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
        I am a senior software engineer with over four years of experience in software development. I have worked at
        Accenture for two years, where I was promoted to a senior position after 14 months of delivering high-quality
        projects. Since 2019, I have been a freelancer, working on various software and products for different clients.
        I am proficient in multiple technologies and always eager to learn new ones. I have excellent communication and
        collaboration skills, and I can work effectively with project managers, UI/UX designers, and clients. I am
        interested in joining Symph Company in Cebu, as I believe I can utilize my best practices for software
        development and quality assurance to meet their needs.</p>
